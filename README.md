# WebAssembly SIMD Programming Reference

** WORK IN PROGRESS **

This project is basically a web interface for exploring the data from
[nemequ/wasm-simd-data](https://github.com/nemequ/wasm-simd-data).

It is currently under very heavy development (i.e., not yet ready for
public use) and only partially complete.
