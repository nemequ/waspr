# WebAssembly SIMD Programming Reference

This project provides a web interface for WebAssembly SIMD.  You can
[view it](https://nemequ.github.io/waspr) online.

The primary data source for the site is [the nemequ/wasm-simd-data
repository](https://github.com/nemequ/wasm-simd-data), which in turn
gets its data from [SIMDe](https://github.com/simd-everywhere/simde),
[clang](https://clang.llvm.org/), and
[LLVM-MCA](https://www.llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-mca.html) in
addition to information in the repository itself.

The site is written in TypeScript using Angular.  See [Angular's set-up
guide](https://angular.io/guide/setup-local) for information about
setting up a local copy.
